            dcterms:description: |
               A new RCM similar to the one built by Mittal [21] was fabricated,
               with improvements made from operational point of
               view and capabilities of attaining higher compression pressures
               as well as wider range of compression ratios. General
               details of the RCM can be found in Mittal and Sung [22].
               The RCM consists of a reaction chamber in which the
               reactant gases are compressed by a creviced piston arrangement.
               The creviced piston is driven by an arrangement of the
               pneumatic piston and high-pressure air tank. It is held in
               place by an arrangement of the pressurized hydraulic
               cylinder. A trigger of a solenoid valve releases the pressure of
               the hydraulic chamber, and thus the piston arrangement
               moves forward by the pneumatic system. Toward the end of
               the compression stroke, the piston is smoothly decelerated
               and finally stopped by the piston stopping groove.
               The end of reaction chamber is equipped with a pressure
               transducer for dynamic measurements and a thermocouple
               for initial temperature monitoring. It is also provided with
               quartz windows for any required optical access. The
               compression ratio of the rapid compression machine can be
               changed by changing the clearance and/or the stroke length.
               Split shims are used between the hydraulic cylinder and the
               reaction chamber to vary the clearance and the stroke can be
               adjusted by using spacers.

               To determine the mixture composition, the
               mass of fuel, equivalence ratio, and oxidizer ratio (XO2 : Xinert, 
               where X indicates mole fraction) are specified. A
               liquid at room temperature which has a relatively low vapor pressure
               (6 Torr at 25 C) is measured gravimetrically in a syringe to
               within 0.01 g of the specified value. Proportions of O2 and N2 in
               the mixture are determined manometrically and added at room
               temperature. The saturated vapor pressure dependence of a liquid fuel
               on temperature is taken from the Chemical Properties Handbook
               by Yaws. The preheat temperature is set above the saturation
               temperature of n-butanol to ensure complete vaporization of the
               fuel. A magnetic stirrer mixes the reactants. The temperature inside
               the mixing tank is allowed approximately 1.5 h to reach steady
               state.
