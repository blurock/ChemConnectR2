            dcterms:description: |
               The dynamic pressure transducer outputs a charge signal that is converted to a voltage signal
               by a charge amplifier with a nominal output of 0V. In addition, the output range of 0V to 10V
               is set by the operator to correspond to a particular pressure range by setting a “scale factor.” The
               voltage output from the charge amplifier is digitized by a hardware data acquisition system and
               recorded into a plain text file by a LabView Virtual Instrument. 
               The primary diagnostic on the RCM is the reaction chamber pressure during and after 
               the compression process, measured by a dynamic pressure transducer. The pressure 
               trace is processed to determine the quantities of interest, including the pressure 
               and temperature at the EOC, PC and TC respectively, and the ignition delay, t.
               These values depend on the pressure and temperature prior to the start of compression (P0 and T0,
               respectively), in addition to the composition of the reactant mixture and the overall compression
               ratio of the RCM. A single compression-delay-ignition sequence is referred to as an experiment or
               a run and a set of experiments at a given PC and mixture composition is referred to as a condition.

               The temperature is measured prior to the start of compression. The initial
               temperature is used in the calculation of the experimental temperature in 
               conjunction with the pressure profile.

               To determine the mixture composition, the
               mass of fuel, equivalence ratio, and oxidizer ratio (XO2 : Xinert, 
               where X indicates mole fraction) are specified. A
               liquid at room temperature which has a relatively low vapor pressure
               (6 Torr at 25 C) is measured gravimetrically in a syringe to
               within 0.01 g of the specified value. Proportions of O2 and N2 in
               the mixture are determined manometrically and added at room
               temperature. The saturated vapor pressure dependence of a liquid fuel
               on temperature is taken from the Chemical Properties Handbook
               by Yaws. The preheat temperature is set above the saturation
               temperature of n-butanol to ensure complete vaporization of the
               fuel. A magnetic stirrer mixes the reactants. The temperature inside
               the mixing tank is allowed approximately 1.5 h to reach steady
               state.
