                The Combustion Chemistry Centre, C3, is engaged in 
                fundamental research on the combustion of fossil and biofuels. 
                Combustion is the ultimate interdisciplinary field: 
                it requires knowledge of chemistry, physics, fluid dynamics, 
                thermodynamics and mathematics. In addition, combustion science 
                has a well defined purpose in society today, facilitating the 
                study and analysis of problems associated with the generation of air 
                pollutants. C3 is concerned with the application of combustion 
                research to the design of energy-efficient engine and gas 
                turbine combustion systems and the impact of their use on 
                toxic and greenhouse gas emissions, thus helping address the 
                problems of urban air pollution and climate change.
