          A rapid compression machine (RCM) has been designed and fabricated
          for the purpose of chemical kinetics studies at elevated pressures
          and temperatures. The present RCM is pneumatically driven
          and hydraulically actuated and stopped. Stroke of the machine varies
          from 7 to 10 inches and clearance is also adjustable. Compression
          ratio of up to 21 can be obtained. The optically-accessible reaction
          chamber is equipped with sensors for the measurements of pressure
          and temperature. In addition, a rapid sampling apparatus is incorporated
          in the reaction chamber for determining species concentration
          at specific post-compression time. A deliberately machined
          crevice on the cylindrical surface of the piston has been optimized,
          using STAR-CD CFD package, in order to suppress the formation
          of the roll-up vortex and provide a homogeneous core of reaction
          mixture. Temperature mapping using planar laser induced fluorescence
          of acetone shows that roll-up vortex is indeed suppressed by
          using the present creviced piston. Experiments with either inert
          gases or reactive mixtures demonstrate the reproducibility of pressure
          traces. Compression process is also shown to be very rapid and
          free from any significant mechanical vibrations. Measurements show
          that highly repeatable compressed conditions of up to 50 bar and
          greater than 1000K can be obtained. A numerical model accounting
          for heat loss is also developed to simulate the RCM data. This work
          documents the design and operation of the present RCM as well as
          establishes its suitability for combustion studies.

          Pneumatic Creviced Piston

          pneumatic
          creviced,
          piston stopping groove
          quartz windows
          hydraulic cylinder
          autoignition delay
     dcterms:description: >
          The creviced piston is driven by an arrangement of the pneumatic
	  piston and high-pressure air tank. It is held in place by an
	  arrangement of the pressurized hydraulic cylinder. A trigger of a
	  solenoid valve releases the pressure of the hydraulic chamber, and
	  thus the piston arrangement moves forward by the pneumatic system.
	  Toward the end of the compression stroke, the piston is smoothly
	  decelerated and finally stopped by the piston stopping groove.
          The end of reaction chamber is equipped with a pressure transducer
	  for dynamic measurements and a thermocouple for initial temperature
	  monitoring. It is also provided with quartz windows for any required
	  optical access. The compression ratio of the rapid compression machine
	  can be changed by changing the clearance and/or the stroke length.
	  Split shims are used between the hydraulic cylinder and the reaction
	  chamber to vary the clearance and the stroke can be adjusted by
	  using spacers.
