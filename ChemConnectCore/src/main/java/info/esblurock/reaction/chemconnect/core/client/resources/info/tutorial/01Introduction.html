		<i>Reading and interpreting data files with CHEMCONNECT</i>
	</p>
	<p>CHEMCONNECT distinguishes itself from other repositories in that
		it has a domain knowledge base that interprets the repository data. In
		a classical repository, a data file is uploaded, possibly with
		keywords and references. The file itself is left to the researcher to
		interpret. In contract, CHEMCONNECT using the knowledge base to parse
		and interpret the data file so the data can be available for
		searching, visualization, interpretation and translation.</p>
	<p>The knowledge base contains information about:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>File Staging</b> How to interpret the file (formats,
			etc.), even if the file has several ‘blocks’ of information.
		<li><b>Data Block Isolation Recognition</b> Specification of a
			‘block’ of information within a data
		<li><b>Parameter Specification</b> How the parameters within the
			data should be interpreted, for example, which keywords are used for
			the parameters and the units of the parameters in the particular data
			set block. This allows correspondences with other data using
			different keywords and different units.
		<li><b>Protocol Specification</b> Typical datasets contain several
			sets of data that are defined by the experiments and devices. What
			information is (should be, as defined a ‘good’ reporting by the
			community) reported for a give experiment on a given device or what
			data sets are normally reported for a given laboratory is specified
			in a protocol.
		<li><b>Data entry</b> Using the protocol specification, the data
			files are interpreted, and the data is entered in the database.
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>The first four stages represents the preliminary, one time, work
		to set up the interpretation of (standard) data files originating from
		a given researcher, laboratory or community. The assumption is that
		file formatting does not change significantly with these groups. As
		new experiments are performed, then stage 5, data entry, is repeated
		(based on the preliminary specifications).</p>
