	<p>The primary tool representing combustion knowledge is the
		ontology from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">semantic web</a>. 
		The ontology also drives
		the user interface. 
		</p>
		<p>The ontology knowledge base provides a template
		description of the devices, the protocols and the data. These general
		templates are filled in with characterizing details (particularly
		differences) of the devices and protocols. Common combustion instrumentation, such as shock
		tubes, rapid compression machines, heat flux burners, molecular beam
		experiments, perfectly stirred reactors, to name a few, and data have
		been characterized and represented within a comprehensive ontology.
		This was done in collaboration with researchers using and developing
		these devices. Included within these ontology descriptions is a
		hierarchy of concepts and purposes giving extended context for more
		generality.
		</p>
		<p>
		For example, the device
		template views an experimental device as a set of subsystems, modules
		and sensors. Associated with each component is a set of parameter
		descriptions (established through literature search and collaboration
		with experimentalists), references (both web and publications),
		images, and text describing these parts and the data produced. These
		descriptions characterize a particular component and differentiates
		them from other similar components. The data is also characterized
		through protocols from ‘raw’ data coming from the instrument sensor,
		to intermediate results and interpretations of the data to the final
		published results. Protocol templates link data sets with
		methodologies, devices and further protocols that manage data to the
		final published result. A dataset template is a set of groups
		measurements. Only the type, such as ‘temperature’ is specified, not
		the specific unit (that choice Is left to the specific application of
		the template).</p>
