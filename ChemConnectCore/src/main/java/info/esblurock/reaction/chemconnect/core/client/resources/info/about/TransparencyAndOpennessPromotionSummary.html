			target="_blank">eight transparency standards</a>, divided into three
		levels of interpretation, for publishers in regard to handling data in
		reviewing scientific publications. The goal of CHEMCONNECT is to
		promote the TOP concept and raise the bar for scientific research and
		data management:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Citation</b>
			<p>Not only does CHEMCONNECT promote citations in the traditional
				sense of publication (and web pages), but also through
				interconnectivity and tracing of data through the whole process
				CHEMCONNECT. The data's origin and connections to methodologies and
				devices (with their citations) are made accessible</p></li>
		<li><b>Data transparency</b>
			<p>The data file provided by the researcher is interpreted and
				the data extracted in context with CHEMCONNECT's extensive knowledge
				base (represented as an ontology). This promotes interpretation,
				comparison and search of the data with other similar data within the
				repository. CHEMCONNECT's knowledge base of units provides
				interconvertibility and searching of results (researchers can use
				the units convenient, possibly for historical reasons, for their
				lab). A hierarchical concept tree helps interpret the results and
				gives them their context with other results (for example,
				researcher's do not need to agree on common keywords). The
				CHEMCONNECT data protocol concept gives links to the devices,
				methodologies and data on which the final results depend. The
				protocol reflects and documents the common practice of a particular
				laboratory.</p></li>
		<li><b>Analytic methods (code) transparency</b>
			<p>CHEMCONNECT promotes providing links to data and documentation
				through the whole process from how the data was collected and
				interpreted (methodologies) from which device, even components the
				measurements were made (devices, subsystems and components), and
				what data is needed in the manipulation of the data to the final
				published result. A key structure in the CHEMCONNECT repository is
				the protocol that is used to interpret the researcher's data files.
				The protocol gives links to the methodologies and other protocols,
				such as calibration, measurement and data manipulation, on which the
				data depends.

		<li><b>Preregistration of studies</b>
			<p></p></li>
		<li><b>Preregistration of analysis plans</b>
			<p></p></li>
		<li><b>Replication</b>
			<p>
			Through the exact documentation of devices, methodologies, from calibration, to measurements, to manipulations,
			and their associated data, results can be verified and replicated by others.
