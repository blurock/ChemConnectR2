		<i>FAIR Data in data management</i>
	</p>
	An important requirement for an open research data project, as defined
	by Horizon 2020, is the FAIR concept, i.e. that data be findable,
	accessible, interoperable and re-usable. The core of the solution is
	ChemConnect, a cloud-based service representing interconnected data.
	Within the FAIR concept, ChemConnect provides search and interfacing:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Findable:</b> The cloud-based service ChemConnect provides
			an advanced data organising concept that links data through semantic
			relationships (the Resource Description Framework of the Semantic Web
			and Ontologies) promotes the searching of data by attaching semantic
			metadata to points in the data set and through this semantic
			providing many paths to a particular piece of data through multiple
			contexts. Data can be found through similarity to other data and
			concepts describing data or through traceability by being the source
			of or being used by other data.</li>
		<li><b>Accessibility:</b> Once the data has been found, whether
			as a point within a data set, the data set itself or the set of data
			sets where they reside, it can be retrieved. ChemConnect can provide
			internal links and for access and visualisation of data and also
			interfacing and links to other sustainable sources.</li>
		<li><b>Interoperable:</b> An important tool within the
			ChemConnect cloud service is to provide interfacing to other tools.
			At the simplest level, this will be done by providing files in the
			appropriate format. Developments will be made to provide direct
			access through APIâ€™s (if that is a priority of the consortium).</li>
		<li><b>Re-usable:</b> This is satisfied by placing data in a
			sustainable repository with extensive meta-data for search and data
			representation, including domain standards (for example, those being
			outlined by the SMARTCATS data task for initiative).
			</li>
