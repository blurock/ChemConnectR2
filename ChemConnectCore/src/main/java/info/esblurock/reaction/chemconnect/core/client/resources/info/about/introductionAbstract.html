		<p><b>ChemConnect</b> is the next generation conntected smart database and repository
		to answer the needs of the information explosion
		</p>
	<p>With the advent of the explosion of data produced within a
		project and with the increasing pressure to have an efficient means to
		communicate and disseminate this data, the role of a well-defined data
		management plan within a proposal is expanding and the requirement
		becoming mandatory. An essential part of a data management plan is a
		sustainable and manageable repository of data.</p>
		<p>
		The goal of CHEMCONNECT is the be the tool at the center of the <a
			href="https://doi.org/10.1515/rebs-2016-0021" target="_blank">research
			ecosystem</a> and to promote <a
			href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR</a>
		of Findable, Accessable, Interoperable and Reusable data. The further
		goal of CHEMCONNECT is to provide the framework of experimental
		documentation, with protocols, methodologies and device descriptions,
		for <a href="DOI: 10.1126/science.aab2374">Transparency and
			Openness Promotion (TOP)</a> trend in scientific publishing.
