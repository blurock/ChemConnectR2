		<i>The background: Years of Knowledge and Know-how</i>
	</p>
	<p>Edward S. Blurock has over 35 years of experience, both in
		chemical data and modelling which is the core of this project (for
		example, REACTION (1) and JTHERGAS (2)), and in applied artificial
		intelligence and machine learning techniques and software (at the
		Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Austria (3) and
		Combustion Physics, Sweden (4)). Currently, he is recognized to be at
		the forefront of data management within the community by being the
		‘Standard definition for data collection and mining toward a virtual
		chemistry of Smart Energy Carriers‘ Working Group leader in COST
		Action network CM1404, ‘Chemistry of Smart Energy Carriers and
		Technologies’(5), and leader of the CM1401 task to catalog data use
		within the community. He is co-editor and co-author of several
		chapters in the book Cleaner Combustion: Developing Detailed Chemical
		Kinetic Models.</p>
