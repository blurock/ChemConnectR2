	<p>With the advent of the explosion of data produced within a
		project and with the increasing pressure to have an efficient means to
		communicate and disseminate this data, the role of a well-defined data
		management plan within a proposal is expanding and the requirement
		becoming mandatory. An essential part of a data management plan is a
		sustainable and manageable repository of data.</p>
	<p>CHEMCONNECT and its fundamental principles and extensive
		knowledge base represents the next generation of data repositories.
		Data files are not just stored. The data within those files are
		interpreted and put into the context of the extensive domain
		knowledge. CHEMCONNECT provides the framework for extensive
		documentation of the entire scientific process from thorough
		descriptions of the measurement devices (including subystems,
		components and sensors), documentation of the methodologies, from
		calibration to measurement to manipulation to final results, and
		research protocols linking together all aspects of the scientific
		process.</p>
	<p>
		The goal of CHEMCONNECT is the be the tool at the center of the <a
			href="https://doi.org/10.1515/rebs-2016-0021" target="_blank">research
			ecosystem</a> and to promote <a
			href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR</a>
		of Findable, Accessable, Interoperable and Reusable data. The further
		goal of CHEMCONNECT is to provide the framework of experimental
		documentation, with protocols, methodologies and device descriptions,
		for <a href="DOI: 10.1126/science.aab2374">Transparency and
			Openness Promotion (TOP)</a> trend in scientific publishing.
	</p>
	<p>A further goal of CHEMCONNECT is to provide a natural framework
		for data entry. The framework is meant to adapt to the researcher
		needs. CHEMCONNECT should accept data, including units and formats, as
		the researcher naturally presents them. The extensive knowledge base
		of CHEMCONNECT plays an essential role in achieving this.</p>
