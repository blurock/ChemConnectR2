		<i>CHEMCONNECT</i>
	</p>
	<p>CHEMCONNECT goes beyond traditional data repositories in that
		the data is parsed, using a laboratory and device specific protocol
		(template) description, and analyzed with respect to an extensive
		chemical and combustion knowledge base within CHEMCONNECT. The parsed
		data is then linked allowing for efficient searching and comparison of
		combustion data. The goal is to report all data associated with
		experiments, from a device description, to device calibrations, the
		intermediate data (both computed and measured), to the final published
		results. Associated with the data are procedure and methodology
		descriptions and associated links and references. Having published
		data linked to its dependent measurements and constants, devices,
		subsystems, sensors and even people and laboratories provides an
		effective accountability and more confidence in the data. Data entry
		and availability can range from private user, to user defined
		consortia to general public.</p>
