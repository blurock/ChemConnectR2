		<b>File Staging</b>
	</p>
	<p>CHEMCONNECT allows and interprets multiple formats (File
		Staging). The file could be a (formatted) text file, a spreadsheet
		(regardless of whether it be csv, xsl, xslx or delimited in some other
		way) or XML.</p>
	<p>A single data file can contain several blocks of information,
		where a block can be view as a set of rows staring with a title. The
		CHEMCONNECT interface, in conjunction with the knowledge base, helps
		isolate these blocks so can be later interpreted (Data Block
		Recognition).</p>
	<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>Parameter Recognition</b>
	</p>
	<p>In a block of data, for example in a spreadsheet, each column
		represents a parameter. Within the CHEMCONNECT knowledge base this
		block is considered one observation set, for example, a set of
		experimental conditions, a pressure, volume or temperature curve, or a
		set of experimental measurements (under the given conditions). The
		CHEMCONNECT interface assists in determining how the block is to be
		interpreted (Parameter Recognition). For example, the first line
		usually specifies the parameter name and implicit (sometimes given
		with the parameter name) with the parameter is its units. Through the
		CHEMCONNECT interface, a correspondence between the data file
		parameter and the ‘standard’ parameter specification within the
		knowledge base is made. An important part of the specification is the
		choice of units. In the CHEMCONNECT specification, only the class of
		parameter, such as temperature, pressure, time, etc., is specified.
		Within this class, a choice of specific units can be made that
		corresponds to units of the data set. Thus, for example, for an energy
		parameter, the data set parameter can be specified to be joules,
		calories, kilocalories, etc.. Within the knowledge base are the
		conversions between the different units.</p>

		<b>Protocol Specification</b>
	</p>
	<p>A given protocol specifies (Protocol Specification) which sets
		of data should be reported for a given experiment or device. Within
		CHEMCONNECT there are protocol associated with calibration (such as a
		mass spectrometer calibration for species), measurement (meaning the
		‘raw’ data coming from the sensors or device) interpretation and data
		manipulation (such as converting a pressure curve to an ignition delay
		time), or published data reporting. In terms of data observations, a
		protocol specifies for each block, a set of parameter specifications
		(from the Parameter Specification step) within the block and how the
		block was isolated from the data (from the Data Block Recognition
		step). Typically, a laboratory or a given experimental community has
		their own ‘standard’ way of reporting data, the data files used, the
		parameters reported and even the units used. Therefore, this protocol
		specification need only be set up once. It is re-used for each
		experimental set within the laboratory or community.</p>
	<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>Data entry</b>
	</p>
	<p>Since the data reporting for a particular lab has, for the most
		part, the same form, the preliminary steps just outlined is done just
		once. The actual data to report, representing set of experiments using
		a particular device within the lab, are collected as data files. The
		data files are interpreted by the protocol specification (Data Entry).
		A protocol specification can refer to several data file sources. A
		correspondence between the data file and the appropriate part of the
		protocol specification is made to determine where in the file the data
		is found and how the parameters are interpreted. The data file is
		stored in its original form, linked with the protocol specification
		and the data extracted for use in the CHEMCONNECT database.</p>
