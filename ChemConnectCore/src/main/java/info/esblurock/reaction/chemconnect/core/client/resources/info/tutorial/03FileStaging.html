		<i>File Staging</i>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>Uploading</b>
	</p>
	<p>The first step in data entry is to upload the file, either from
		the local filesystem, a web address or with typing in directly with an
		entry field. The upload file is first stored in its entirety in the
		file staging area. There are no restrictions as to the type of file
		that is uploaded, but no interpretation of the file has been made.</p>
	<p>
		<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>File Type</b>
	</p>
	<p>The next (semi-automatic) step is to determine which class, as
		interpreted by the knowledge base, the data file belongs to. Some clue
		of the data type is given by the MIME type extracted and associated
		with the file. For example, a csv spreadsheet file has a MIME type of
		‘text/csv’, meaning that a csv file is a text file with the form of a
		‘comma separated values’ text. From the MIME type, the knowledge
		further refines the file type. Two sets of choices are offered, one
		based on the MIME type and one based on the extension of the file. For
		a csv file, these are the same, meaning a ‘SpreadSheetCSV’ classified
		file within the database. However, for other types of files, for
		example, simple text files, the choice can be automated and the user
		must supply more information. For example, is could be a spreadsheet
		with another delimitor (space or tab) or even a ‘chemical’ file such
		as a chemkin mechanism, thermodynamic file or transport data file.</p>
	<p>
		<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>File Catalog Type</b>
	</p>
	<p>The second classification is the ‘catalog’ classification type.
		For example, spreadsheets, no matter what source type they have, all
		represent matrices. A matrix can also be defined through a yaml or XML
		file. So whether the original source file was a spreadsheet, a yaml
		file or an XML file, the way the data is stored and interpreted is as
		a matrix (a CHEMCONNECT ‘DataFileMatrixStructure’). In all further
		specifications and manipulations, when a matrix file is called for,
		these structures will come forth, once again, regardless of its
		original source form.</p>
	<p>
		<br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>File Identification and Accessibility</b>
	</p>
	<p>Thus the first stage to interpret the file format, the data
		source identification is formed. This consists of several parts
		(common to all CHEMCONNECT data objects: see tutorial on catalog
		identification for more details: 
		<ul>
		<li><b>Base Catalog Location:</b> The location
		of the data within the user’s catalog system. 
		<li><b>File Type:</b> The
		identification of the data type that the source file represents. For
		example, a spreadsheet is, usually, of type ‘DataFileMatrixStructure’.
		<li><b>Data source name:</b> This is the free text identifying this file,
		basically a unique filename. 
		<li><b>Accessibility:</b> This is a pull-down list
		of who (and how) the data source can be accessed. It can be public,
		the user or a member of a consortium. 
		</ul>
		<p>
		In addition, unique to file
		staging is how to read the information in the file. In the example
		above, the csv file is read and interpreted as a ‘SpreadSheetCSV’. If
		the file is a text file, the field below these choices shows the text.
		Before the source text file is submitted, the text can be modified in
		case the source differs from the expected source type.
		</p>
	<p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">
		<b>Interpreting to the database</b>
	</p>
	<p>Upon clicking ‘SUBMIT’ the file source is read in an interpreted
		appropriately. After successful interpretation, a catalog object is
		created and the file information is visualized. In the case of a
		matrix of data (‘DataFileMatrixStructure’), the catalog information is
		a ‘ObservationsFromSpreadSheetFull’ (transparent to the user,
		actually) with the standard catalog object information such as title,
		description, concept, purpose, time stamps, etc. In addition,
		references (paper or web site references) or links (for example to
		other associated data objects, pictures, references to the device,
		association with a lab or person who produced or entered the data,
		etc.). These fields can be modified and updated. Updating is done the
		the SAVE button.</p>
